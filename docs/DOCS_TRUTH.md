# Docs truth (`docs/_map.mjs`)

Deterministic document-health lint for THEORUM. No waivers. No LLM.

## Export

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| CLI | `scripts/docs-truth/cli.mjs` (`lint`, `inventory`, `freshness`) |
| Export drift | `scripts/docs-truth/export-drift.mjs` |
| Graph | `docs/_map.mjs` |

## Ownership

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/docs-truth/graph.mjs` | Graph load, ownership, evidence, freshness |
| `scripts/docs-truth/cli.mjs` | `lint`, `inventory`, `freshness` |
| `scripts/docs-truth/export-drift.mjs` | Entrypoint export vs contract drift |
| `scripts/docs-truth/graph.test.mjs` | Contract tests |
| `docs/_map.mjs` | Export → doc ownership graph |

## Rules

| Rule | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Full ownership | Every production-root file has exactly one `owns` entry |
| Doc freshness | Changed *existing* code → owning doc appears in git diff (deletions skipped) |
| Section freshness | Watches/`section_triggers` → specific `##` headings must change |
| Owned fallback | Owned files → at least one behavioral section hunk |
| Evidence | ≥2 supports; behavioral sections require `contract_test` |
| Export drift | Entry `mod.ts` export names appear in owner contract |

## Production roots

| Root | Files |
| --- | --- |
| `mod.ts` | Package barrel |
| `package.json` | Published exports |
| `src/**/*.ts` | Kernel + adapters (live tree only; deleted paths skip freshness) |
| `scripts/docs-truth/**/*.mjs` | Docs-truth linter |

## CI and hooks

| Layer | Command |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | Runs `lint:docs` first, then biome / ast-grep / fallow |
| `deno task lint` | Same as `npm run lint` |
| CI | `npm run lint:docs` with `THEORUM_DOCS_BASE=origin/<base>` |
| Pre-commit | `npm run lint:docs` (auto-installed by `prepare` on `npm install`) |

Fallow: `docs/_map.mjs` is listed under `dynamicallyLoaded` in `.fallowrc.jsonc`
(docs-truth imports it at runtime; static analysis cannot see the edge).

Re-install manually: `npm run hooks:install`
